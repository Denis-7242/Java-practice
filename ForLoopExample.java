/*The for Loop
 What it does:

The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat a block of code.
Itâ€™s best for counting or iterating through things (like numbers or array elements). */

// ðŸ’¡ Syntax:

/*for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}*/


public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + i);
        }
    }
}
